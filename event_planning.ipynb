      "Host your meeting at The Moscone Center and join a proud history of ground-breaking, paradigm-shifting moments.\n",
      "The Moscone Center has hosted some of the most important conventions and product announcements in recent memory, providing the space and amenities for businesses and organizations from the U.S. and beyond to celebrate their achievements and anticipate the future.\n",
      "Salesforce\n",
      "A critical provider of marketing, sales and cloud technologies on the national and global stages, Salesforce is now the world’s No. 1 customer relationship management company. Since 2005, the company’s annual Dreamforce conference has become a staple of the Moscone calendar, with attendees coming to San Francisco from all over the world.\n",
      "Product demos, immersive trainings, and distinguished guests including former Vice President  Al Gore  and PG&E CEO Geisha J. Williams are just a few reasons people flock to Dreamforce.\n",
      "Oracle\n",
      "Oracle is another premier software provider that helps its customers manage marketing, sales and commerce in the cloud. Oracle Openworld, the annual convention run by the database and cloud engineering giant, brings innovation and exploration to The Moscone Center each year.\n",
      "Oracle has been holding Openworld events at Moscone since 1998, delivering a wide variety of demos and sessions to attendees. Each year, the company has also revealed their discoveries and new products to the world as they revolutionize the database and IT management industries. A diverse group of featured speakers, including physicists and CEOs from various industries, keep that tradition alive at Oracle Openworld 2018.\n",
      "Google\n",
      "Google held its flagship I/O conference at The Moscone Center from 2008 to 2015. Attendees witnessed some of the most exciting events in the global giant’s history.\n",
      "The first I/O included an introduction to the Android operating system, months before the release of the first mobile device that would utilize it. Android would go on to become the most popular mobile operating system in the world.\n",
      "Apple\n",
      "IDG’s Macworld conference, a premier trade show for Apple products and services, was held at The Moscone Center from 1985 to 2014. The popularity of the event grew as Apple did, and the tech giant was a major sponsor of the event even before the announcements of multiple products that would change the way people lived forever.\n",
      "In 2001, Steve Jobs unveiled iTunes at The Moscone Center, heralding the age of digital music. Later that year, the iPod would be released, which would redefine the mobile experience as consumers knew it.\n",
      "Apple returned to The Moscone Center to deliver paradigm-shifting news year after year. Macworld attendees were the first to be introduced to the iPhone in 2007, the Macbook Air in 2008, and other devices that have come to define modern life.\n",
      "Microsoft\n",
      "Microsoft Build, the company’s signature software development conference, has been held at Moscone four times since 2013, adding important milestones to the convention center’s history.\n",
      "Some of the company’s biggest announcements were made at The Moscone Center, including the introductions of the Surface Pro and the digital assistant Cortana. These important additions to the Microsoft product suite solidified the focus on slimmer computing technology and AI-assisted lifestyles that modern consumers have come to expect.\n",
      "Game Developers Conference\n",
      "Mainstream audiences are much more aware of gaming today than they were when the Game Developers Conference first came to The Moscone Center in 2005.\n",
      "Since 2007, GDC has become one of the most talked-about annual events in the gaming industry, providing a window into emerging and innovative gaming technologies.\n",
      "Success at The Moscone Center has helped GDC to expand and add different events across the globe, including the Independent Games Festival, an award show celebrating the best independent game developers in the industry.\n",
      "The Medical Community\n",
      "Groundbreaking medical conferences continue to return to The Moscone Center. Esteemed organizations like the American Dental Association, Heart Rhythm Society, American College of Surgeons, and the American Psychiatric Association come to The Moscone Center to discuss and discover the breakthroughs that redefine modern medicine.\n",
      "In the upcoming months, Moscone will host the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, and the Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium, among others. These organizations and others are booking years in advance to bring their attendees and their achievements back to San Francisco.\n",
      "Looking Forward\n",
      "San Francisco is a diverse and productive home for innovative companies, and The Moscone Center is where all of that innovation can be put on display. The latest renovations will increase The Moscone Center’s appeal in the eyes of businesses worldwide. New innovators and groups from a variety of industries are eager to add to the history of significant announcements made at The Moscone Center.\n",

      "The San Francisco Bay Area is the perfect place to hold your next conference. The area boasts a diverse range of conference venues for rent, from historic buildings to modern high-rise towers. Whether you're looking for a venue that offers a unique experience for your guests or space to accommodate large groups, here are some of the tips you may find useful when renting a conference venue:\n",
      "Make sure the venue is easy to find and get to. Check whether it has adequate parking space or is situated close to major hotels, airports, or other important locations. The venue should also have decent access to a good network of transportation links.\n",
      "Find a venue that fits your guests like a glove . The capacity of the venue should be able to accommodate your expected number of attendees and provide the necessary furniture and equipment for your event.\n",
      "Check if the venue can cater to your needs. If the venue doesn't have in-house catering, it might permit outside services. In some cases, they may offer you a list of recommended vendors who can assist you with your catering needs.\n",
      "Find a venue with the proper infrastructure. Make sure that there are enough restrooms, cloakrooms, etc., for your guests. If you’re planning an event with multiple breakout sessions or workshops, make sure the venue has enough breakout rooms. If you're planning a large event, you may be able to rent out an entire floor in a building or have the venue at your disposal for the entire day.\n",
      "Make sure the venue has the necessary equipment. Some venues have their own equipment that can be used for your conference, but others may require you to bring your own. This might include PA systems, microphones, projectors, and screens. If you want to use any special equipment during your event, check if the venue has them available.\n",
      "Check if the venue has a built-in sound system. You need to make sure that your guests can hear the speakers clearly when they attend your conference. You may want to rent wireless microphones to avoid the hassle of dealing with tangled wires.\n",
      "Make sure the venue has adequate lighting. The venue should be able to accommodate your choice of natural or artificial lighting, depending on the ambience that matches your preference. Natural lighting is better for creating a warm, welcoming atmosphere while artificial lighting is more suitable for creating a professional ambience.\n",
      "Ensure that the venue has air conditioning. You need to make sure that your guests are comfortable throughout the event and can enjoy themselves without being distracted by heat or humidity. You can also opt for a venue with a cooling system instead.\n",
      "Check if you can customize the space to your needs. You should have control over the layout of the venue's space to create the best possible environment for your conference. Special seating arrangements may be necessary if you are giving a speech and need to address the audience from the stage.\n",
      "Conferences and meetings are a great way to get together with your team, clients, or other people in your industry. They can be used to promote products and services or create stronger relationships with your network. People often rent conference venues for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n",
      "Business Meetings . If you need to host a business meeting, then renting a conference venue is probably the best way to go about it. Many businesses have regular meetings with clients and suppliers, and these events can be held at a rented conference venue instead of a cramped meeting room.\n",
      "Conferences . If you have a large group of people who need to attend a conference, then you need a suitable venue for such events. Most of these venues have the facilities needed to run a successful conference, including catering services, audio-visual equipment, and a stage for speakers and presentations.\n",
      "Networking Events . If you're in the business of connecting people, then a conference venue can be an important part of your strategy. Choosing the right venue can increase the sense of prestige or success surrounding your event. It's also great for building your brand and displaying your talents as a speaker or host.\n",
      "Exhibitions . Renting a conference venue is a great way to showcase your products and services to potential customers or clients in an attractive and professional setting. You can take advantage of the opportunity to impress your guests and make connections with potential partners.\n",
      "Conventions . If you want to get your colleagues together for an annual event to learn about the latest trends in their field and network with others in their industry, renting a conference venue might be just what you need! You may also want to rent a conference venue if you have an important announcement to make or want to hold a special celebration.\n",
      "Training Sessions. Training sessions are a great way for your company to stay on top of the latest trends in your industry. If your company is looking to train its employees, why not rent a conference venue and bring everyone together? This gives you the opportunity to hire a professional trainer and host a seminar that is relevant to your business in a professional setting.\n",
      "Expos . These events are intended to show off your product and generate some buzz around it. They're also a great way to get exposure, which can be difficult if you're hosting your event in a cramped space. Consider renting a conference venue instead to make the most of your time and money.\n",
      "FAQs about Conference Venues in San Francisco, CA\n",
      "How much does it cost to rent a conference venue in San Francisco?\n",
      "The average price for renting a conference venue is about $1,500-$2,000 per session . This price is based on the location and number of guests attending the event. If you have more than 300 people coming to your conference, you should expect to pay at least $2,500+ per session. The price of your conference will also increase depending on how many days it lasts and whether or not you need catering.\n",
      "Which areas of San Francisco are best for renting a conference venue?\n",
      "The Financial District. This area is perfect for conferences of any size and price range, with spaces that range from intimate to expansive. It's also got plenty of hotels nearby if you need accommodation.\n",
      "Downtown . This district has a lot of great options for conference venues, from historic buildings to modern spaces designed with your needs in mind. It's also close to the Financial District, so it won't take you long to get there!\n",
      "Russian Hill . If you're looking for something more historic or old-fashioned than what the Financial District has to offer, check out Russian Hill! The neighborhood is known for its Victorian houses, which make it a great place for conference venues that have a unique flair.\n",
      "Union Square . This area has some great options too! It's a very modern area with lots of restaurants and hotels, which makes it a great choice if you're planning on having some events during the conference.\n",
      "What are some of the best conference venues in San Francisco?\n",
      "Main Hall at Trellis . This versatile space can accommodate everything from daytime conferences under the sun to evening panel discussions. With its brick walls and redwood rafters, it got the rustic charm of an old-school barn—except it's got Edison bulbs instead of hay bales. It was designed to be a comfortable, inviting space with satin curtains and a curated collection of art and furniture. It's the perfect place to hold a special event that is going to delight your guests.\n",
      "California Ballroom at Oakstop Franklin . This is a quintessential venue for your next conference. Its beautiful art deco architecture is going to leave your guests in awe, and the adjoining meeting lounge offers more options for groups that require a VIP area, a breakout space, etc. Don’t let the name fool you, as this is not just a ballroom, but rather a multi-purpose venue that can be configured to accommodate different types of events, including large conferences and corporate meetings.\n",
      "Imperial Ballroom at Hotel Kabuki. The venue is conveniently located in Western Addition. It's a bright, warm room that is ideal for ensuring that your attendees can concentrate on the topic at hand. The room can be set up with a whiteboard, or you can use the projector to display presentations. The venue also provides in-house catering and complimentary water. It's perfect for conferences.\n",
      "What should I consider when choosing a conference venue in San Francisco?\n",
      "The most important thing to consider when planning an event is how your guests will interact with each other—and what amenities you can offer them to make their experience relaxing and productive. When you're searching for venues, look for places that offer Wi-Fi, projectors and screens, comfortable seating options, and a PA system or music speakers. You may also want to include amenities like food options (if you're holding an event that lasts more than a few hours) and on-site parking in your search. It's also important to consider if the venue has breakout rooms or dedicated spaces for attendees to hold private discussions. If you're planning a seminar or training event that takes place over the course of a few days, find a venue with lodging accommodations, like hotels with conference rooms.\n",

GFLs can level-up your RAG architecture by generating more insights on top of your data. This empowers you to implement smarter chatbots, agents, and other AI-driven solutions. Based on hands-on examples, we will explore the following questions: a) What are GFLs are? b) How do GFLs work? c) What challenges and use-cases can we tackle with GFLs; and d) How can I define my AI workflows to implement GFLs. \n",

Venues & Destinations 10 New Tech-Forward Venues in New York New hotels, eateries, and event spaces that have above-average tech offerings. Carla Hay October 31, 2016\n",
      "Technological advances are often crucial for event planners to have a marketing edge. Here are new and recently renovated New York venues that have stayed on top of upgrades and improved offerings for tech-savvy guests. The hotels, conference centers, restaurants, private rooms, and other spaces can accommodate groups large or small for private and corporate events, conferences, meetings, weddings, business dinners, teambuilding activities, cocktail parties, and more. 1. Sony Square NYC Sony Square NYC , a showplace for the latest in Sony entertainment and technology, opened in August at Sony Corporation of America's headquarters in Midtown's NoMad neighborhood. The 2,500-square-foot space, which holds 150 for receptions, is available for private events, although events not affiliated with Sony will be chosen selectively. The venue serves as a showcase for new products and ideas from the electronics company including a PlayStation allows visitors to check out the latest games, experience virtual reality with PlayStation VR, and try out PlayStation Vue, Sony Interactive Entertainment's nationwide cloud-based TV service. Sony's LifeSpace UX products at the venue include Glass Sound Speaker, LED Bulb Speaker, and Portable Ultra Short Throw Projector.

The 42,766-square-foot iPic Fulton Market has eight screening rooms that can seat a total of 500 people. The venue, which offers restaurant-style cuisine and waiter service in each screening room, can hold about 840 for receptions. The theater has NEC Digital projectors, Strong/MDI screens, and a bar called the Tuck Room. Each room has custom seating pods with sound-absorbing technology to ensure guests experience the full effect of iPic’s 7.1 channel Dolby digital sound as well as built-in cubbyholes for guests to stash shoes and bags. Guests can opt for premium levels of service that offer perks such as courtesy pillows, blankets, and unlimited popcorn, as well as push-button access to a “dining in the dark” menu by chief restaurant officer Sherry Yard, along with libations from master bartender/advanced sommelier Adam Seger. Photo: Courtesy of iPic Theaters 3. Project Farmhouse Expected to open in November in Manhattan's Union Square, the 3,500-square-foot Project Farmhouse from Grow NYC will be a combination of a test kitchen, a conference room, and a vertical grow wall with moving trays. The venue, which is in the space formerly occupied by the nightclub Spa, can hold 240 for receptions, and will host events and classes on sustainability and nutrition, as well as other events for nonprofits. Designed by architecture firm ORE Design, the space implements cutting-edge technology through its kinetic hydroponic growing wall that rotates, requiring less water and light using LED technology. The high ceiling will be flanked with an acoustical baffle design reflecting a timber farm feel while disguising the mechanics of the space. The acoustical tiles are made from recycled water bottles. The counter tops in the teaching kitchen are made of re-engineered lava from an active volcano in Italy. Wood features throughout the space are built from repurposed woods from a demolished building in Manhattan, as well as tropical hardwood rescued after 40 years of being submerged in a man-made lake in Panama.

      "I grew up in a culture and city that is known for its food. Being Mexican and from El Paso, Texas food was the most important aspect for every celebration. In 2019 I started a cooking club when I moved to Arizona. I had zero experience in catering, I wasn’t a chef but I knew I LOVED people, food and I loved celebrating life! The cooking club grew to 600 members in 3 months. I knew there was something bigger I could do, so I started The Phoenix Palate. Which offers culinary experiences that are tailored to each of our clients needs.  The company grew during the pandemic and now employs over 15+ people and has successfully executed over 500 cooking classes, weddings, intimate dinner parties, corporate functions and many more types of events in the last 2 years. In August 2021 I decided to expand to Southern California and The Pacific Coast Palate was born. With that brand we have been able to serve luxury brands such as Ferrari and many A-List clients.  I decided to start Desert Flower Catering at the beginning of 2022. I realized there were luxury catering brands and everyday casual catering. But nothing in between! I wanted something fun, with amazing food but not too pretentious. We wanted to be able to offer casual food presented nicely, and to be mindful of waste. Being an environmentally conscious company is a huge priority for us. We hope to have a groovy experience with everybody we serve. Much love, Alexis\n",

      "I was born and raised in the sunny city of Phoenix, Arizona. Growing up in a big city where foods of all cultures are right at your hands, I have had a love for food from a young age. Growing up I would often pretend I was on a cooking show while my mom and I cooked together. I loved to bake and cook for my friends and family for as long as I can remember.  While I pursued a degree in Environmental Studies, straying away from my love for the culinary arts, it is a dream to be able to still bring an amazing experience to people’s events through the planning side. Working with clients and being able to bring people together all through the love of food is what I will always strive to do! Whether you’re planning your wedding, baby shower, bringing lunch into your workspace, or even meal preps for the week, I am here to help you have an amazing meal!\n",

      "Hello I'm Richard Bates, the Creative Director for The Phoenix Palate. With over 25 years of experience, I'm equipped to help you plan an unforgettable, personal culinary experience!  Prior to moving to Phoenix, I called Chicago home. While there I held a variety of positions within the food and beverage industry including; server, bartender, beverage director, Maitre'd, and front of house manager.  When I relocated to Phoenix, I was extremely lucky to become part of the Barrio Cafe family. For over a decade I worked with James Beard Award nominee Chef Silvana Salcido. Barrio Cafe has served  chef inspired takes on traditional Mexican classics for over 20 years. My last experience there was General Manager of Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva, a small boutique restaurant focusing on chef tasting menus, and exceptional one of a kind Mexican wines.  I would describe myself as a fun loving person who likes to laugh, and loves to provide an exceptional client experience. If you have a vision, as your creative director, I can help bring that vision to life!\n",
